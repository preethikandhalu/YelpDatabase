# YelpDatabase
Develop Java GUI to query subset of Yelp Database

Goal: Design a GUI in Java that queries a subset of the yelp database (database in Oracle DB) based on user's search criteria.

Steps:
1) Given 4 JSON files containining multiple attributes associated with the Yelp Database. JSON files contained subset of the Yelp database. 
2) Design SQL DDL in OracleDB using SQL Developer after looking through JSON files and identifying attributes required for the database
3) Develop Java code in Eclipse that parses through JSON files (each JSON on average had about 200k entries. One had about 800,000), and
  populated OracleDB
4) Design GUI
   Part a: Front end. Design GUI in Java using NetBeans. Make sure all the attributes based on which the user can search are present in the GUI
   Part b: Design dynamic queries based on the selection of the user in the GUI

Missing from repo: JSON files
